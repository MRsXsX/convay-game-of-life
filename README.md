This project is a simple demonstration of Conway's Game of Life in terminal using Java. The Game of Life simulates the evolution of a grid of cells over time based on the following rules, demonstrating how simple rules can create complex behaviors.

## Rules

1. **Birth**: A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell.
2. **Survival**: A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors remains alive.
3. **Death by Underpopulation**: A live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies.
4. **Death by Overpopulation**: A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies.
